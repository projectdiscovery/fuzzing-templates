----

Fuzzing templates are used with [nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) scanner which powers the actual scanning engine. This repository contains various fuzzing templates for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.

We welcome contributions from the community through pull requests or issues to increase the coverage of security testing. Unlike the [nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) project, which focuses on known vulnerabilities, fuzzing templates are specifically designed to **discover previously unknown vulnerabilities** in applications.

Please navigate to https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/protocols/http-fuzzing/ for detailed documentation to **build your own fuzzing** template.
We have also added a set of templates to help you understand how things work.
